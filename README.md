# Semantic-sentence-similarity-in-texts-with-Python-

These algorithms calculate the distance or the similarity between two text strings in terms of: the number of transformations that must be made in one string to obtain the other (Levenshtein, Hamming distance); of the angle between the vectors of both strings (Cosine Similarity), of the degree of 'commonality', that is, unique terms shared, between the compared strings (Jaccard, Tanimoto and Sorensen-Dice coefficients), of the degree of agreement between the characters of the compared strings (Jaro distance).

These are syntactic algorithms, which do not consider the meaning of sentences, it can result in different results.

16 different measures were implemented in Python 3.6 language to measure the semantic similarity between two predefined phrases, for this purpose training and test files were used.
